Sequence to publish next version:
    > make clean
    > git add relevant_files
    > git commit -m "Whatever message"
    > make
Edit settings to contain the correct version number
    > make public [results in an entry in tirific_pubver]
    > cd www
Edit construct.tcsh and web pages to contain the new version
    > construct.tcsh [creates the www pages in a directory ${tirific_www} specified in construct.tcsh]
    > cd ${tirific_www} (use the directory)
    > git add --all
    > git commit -am "Next www page" (-a means add first all changes to known files, so not really necessary, but also not harmful)
    > git push origin gh-pages
    > cp $tirific_www/tirific_i.j.k.patch.tar.gz $tirific [where $tirific is where the public tirific is]

TiRiFiC Version 2.i.i

TiRiFiC is a program that serves for the fitting
of synthetic (tilted-ring) datacubes to an existent datacube. The executable produced  is the GIPSY routine tirific in the directory
gipsy. This routine depends to some extent on the other modules and is
hence distributed (at the moment) with all the source code that you
find here.
It is planned to provide enhanced versions as a stand-alone program.

The organisation is as follows:
Makefile                Makefile for compilation    
bin                     Stand-alone binaries (currently not used)
doc                     Source code documentation (Install doxygen to 
                        generate the documentation)
gipsy                   GIPSY routines (tirific)
include                 Include files
qfits-4.3.7             original qfits library
qfits-4.3.7-mod         modified qfits library
qfits-4.3.7-mod.tar.gz  Compressed modified qfits library
qfits-4.3.7.tar.gz      Compressed qfits library
rawdocu                 Some documentation setup files
settings                Local setup file
src                     Source code and object files
xmemory                 Changed source code of the qfits library, 
                        especially the xmemory module
gft                     sampler of fitting routines

Installation:

1. Install auxiliary libraries

tirific depends on several external libraries that are not contained
in this package. It is very well possible that they already exist for
the common user, so we left the installation to the user instead of
regenerating them and producing redundant interfering files:

 1. GIPSY amd the GIPSY library
 2. FFTW (in the fftw3f version)
 3. The GSL library
 4. The pgplot library
(5. doxygen only for source code and module documentation)

2. Edit the settings file

Edit the settings file according to the location of the auxiliary
files and the preferred compiler setup (it worked with the
gcc...).

3. Local qfits

Type:
make qfits

The local qfits library will be produced. It is a slightly modified
version of the qfits library by Nicolas Devillard and Yves Jung and
probably not up-to-date with the current version. This imposes no
problems for our program. The major changes consists of removing all
functionality of the so-called xmemory module, which has proved to be
essential.

3. Compiling the source

Type:
make (return)

4. Task documentation

TiRiFiC is documented online here:
http/www.astron.nl/tirific/

5. Source code and module description

We use the doxygen software to document the source code. Once the
documentation has been generated by:

make document (return)

it can be accessed by opening the index.html file in doc/html with a
browser of your choice. We recommend to have a look at the ftstab
module, and the memory_here module, which after minor changes are
useful stand-alones.

6. Cleaning up:

Type:
make clean

7. Running tirific 

To run tirific, put it in the directory where you want to run it or
into the exe(/linux) directory of gipsy or produce a symbolic link to
your TiRiFiC installation. Tirific is accessible only in the GIPSY
environment at the moment. It can be started with typing the command
tirific in a GIPSY shell or by calling nhermes (see GIPSY
documentation).
